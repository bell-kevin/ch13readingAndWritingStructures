# ch13readingAndWritingStructures

In the section in the book about creating records with structures, page 881, there is code for 2 programs, one for writing a struct to a file, one for reading a struct from a file. In this project, you will combine those into one program.

Create a C++ project that uses a file to hold information about the inventory for a store. It can be any type of store, any type of products -- these instructions use an office supply store with 4 objects, pens, blue pencils, black pencils, and erasers. The inventory structure has a name, a price, and a quantity. The first part of the project asks the user for information about each inventory item and writes the structure to the file. The second half of the project reads the inventory data from the file and displays it on the screen.

Notice that the user enters inventory information until they specify they are done. Note that the name of an inventory object can be more than one word. The store inventory is displayed in a tabular format with 2 decimal places for money numbers.

Run the project and take a screenshot of the results, as shown above. Look at the file that was created in NotePad++ and take a screenshot. That is a binary file, and it will look something like this:

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
